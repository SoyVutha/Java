1. Class container everything (blueprint)
2. Object is just instance of the Class
3. Blueprint = a place to store items inside it 
4. The public acess modifier = can be use from all file
5. The private access modifier = cannot be used from all file 
6. constructor is not a return type
7. constructor used to set the default value
8. constructor have 2 tpye: no parameter, have parameter 
9.  In Java, each public class must be in its own file named after that class.
10. Linklist and ListNode is the same concept, but the linklist is built in , while the listnode is needed to be manual writing
11. array[i] => this will get the value at index i of the array
12. get(i) => this will get the value at index i of the ArrayList
13. charAt(i) => this will get the value at index i of the string 
14. Hashmap is a type of data strucuture that has both the head and value (Note, data)
15. indexOf use to find the index of the string or character
16. the listnode use val to access value
17. for(int i=0;list1!=null;i++) => this is how to loop through the listnode
18. Collections.sort => use for data strucuture
19. Integer.sort => use for array
20. The variable inside one file, cannot be access to another file directly, we have to use the getter
21. when pasting the obejct to a method, memory will be paste
22. Encapulation -> the concept of using setter and getter, we protect the data , but the another file can access and assign value to the data, but wont affect the parent 
23. Wrapper = Non primitive
24. The super in java is used to override the constructor of the parent 
25. abstract is a modifier used to indicate that a class or method is incomplete. 
+Abstract Method: You want to define some common methods that many classes will share, but leave certain methods for each class to define
+Abstract Class: An abstract class is a class that can't be instantiated directly. You can't create an object of an abstract class on its own
26. Abstract method must be in the Abstract Class
